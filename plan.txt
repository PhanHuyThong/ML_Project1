1. show results from logistic and MSE (SGD, GD and normal equations) on 5000 samples report mean and variance of cross validation 5 fold, show graph of mean testing accuracy vs iteration (5000): [MSE(normal) : mean = 0.75, std = 0.009879271228182784] 
2. Adaptive step size parce que the step size changes with the size of the training data, show accuracy converges for 500 iters
3. Feature engineering (compare with previous step)
4. Choose the best features 
5. Compare stochastic: time/complexity
6. Higher order estimations, adding more features comme x**2, x**3 on peux montrer un escalation en accuracy (mean, variance Mais en francaise)
7. Regularization, feature selection by L1? Compare L1 and L2, show the good graph
8. Run Cross Validation On All Models And Choose
